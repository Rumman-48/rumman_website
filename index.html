    <p class="about">
    Rumman is a political collective based in Dresden, founded in 2024.
It brings together people with different political and life backgrounds to critically examine Germany’s role in international conflicts and to challenge dominant narratives within local leftist spaces.

Formed around the question of Palestine during the past two years of genocide, the collective works to build community and spaces of discussion grounded in a decolonial perspective, prioritising the voices and experiences of affected communities.

Rumman is currently launching its first thematic campaign: ERASURE 2026.
