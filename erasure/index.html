    <h1>ERASURE 2026</h1>

    <p>
      We approach erasure not as a metaphor, but as a social process.
      Erasure names the ways in which people, histories, places, and forms
      of violence are made absent from public life. This absence is rarely
      accidental. It is produced through institutions, narratives, and
      everyday habits of perception.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the context where we live, Dresden in 2026, memory plays a central
      role in public discourse. Yet memory is often framed as an individual
      experience or as an exceptional historical event. Such framings detach
      remembrance from ongoing structures of power and responsibility.
      They allow certain histories to be remembered while others are
      marginalised, and they present the past as closed rather than connected
      to the present.
    </p>

    <p>
      ERASURE begins from the idea that forgetting is not the opposite of
      memory, but one of its conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
      Public memory is always shaped by what is excluded or left unnamed.
      Erasure takes place through archives that do not collect, through
      language that softens or obscures violence, and through forms of
      commemoration that remove political causes from view. It also appears
      in reporting that isolates events from the systems that produce them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our focus is therefore not only on what is forgotten, but on how
      forgetting happens. Erasure operates when resistance is renamed as
      threat, when displacement is described without naming responsibility,
      and when colonialism, fascism, and racial violence are treated as
      historical exceptions rather than as forces that continue to shape
      the present.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the same time, erasure is uneven. Some losses are publicly mourned
      and officially recognised, while others are rendered invisible or
      ungrievable. Some histories are preserved through monuments and
      education, while others survive only through fragments, oral memory,
      or diaspora. ERASURE pays attention to these differences and to the
      hierarchies that organise who is seen and who is not.
    </p>

    <p>
      The campaign asks what remains outside the frame of public remembrance.
      Whose lives are missing from the archive. Which forms of violence are
      denied, normalised, or postponed into silence. These questions are not
      only about the past. They also concern the present, and the ways
      current struggles, conflicts, and displacements are already being
      shaped into future absences.
    </p>

    <p>
      Across the campaign we work collectively through study, conversation,
      walking, listening, screening, and shared gatherings. These practices
      are not meant to offer closure. They are ways of paying attention.
      We understand remembrance as an ongoing responsibility that requires
      situating memory within systems of power and inequality.
    </p>

    <p>
      ERASURE does not claim to recover everything that has been lost. Nor
      does it seek to speak on behalf of those who have been silenced.
      Instead, it stays with what is missing. It makes absence visible and
      open to question.
    </p>

    <p>
      In doing so, ERASURE resists the comfort of selective memory and
      invites forms of remembrance that remain collective, political,
      and unfinished.
    </p>
